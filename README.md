# Journal: Machine-Learning-to-Detect-malicious-Network-Activity

The field of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has made advancements in the analysis of harmful networks. Monitoring a network’s activity for anomalies—differences from normalcy profiles previously learnt from benign traffic and often found using technologies taken from the machine learning community is a prominent strategy in network intrusion detection research for identifying assaults. Systems for detecting anomalies locate departures from anticipated behavior. They report variations from that profile as warnings based on a perception of typical activities. Any anomaly detection system is predicated on the fundamental premise that malicious activity displays traits that are not present in everyday use. 

Objectives 
• The objective is to detect such malicious network traffic to alleviate their impact on organizations and provide security administrators with automatic alerts 
• This work addresses the issue of malicious network traffic detection using deep convolutional neural network architectures on the modern complex and challenging dataset. 
• The system can detect, classify, and generate alarms for abnormal traffic in the network, with a lower false alarm rate. Based on the dataset, we tested the binary classification of network traffic.
