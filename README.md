# Journal: Machine-Learning-to-Detect-malicious-Network-Activity

The field of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has made advancements in the analysis of harmful networks. Monitoring a network’s activity for anomalies—differences from normalcy profiles previously learnt from benign traffic and often found using technologies taken from the machine learning community is a prominent strategy in network intrusion detection research for identifying assaults. Systems for detecting anomalies locate departures from anticipated behavior. They report variations from that profile as warnings based on a perception of typical activities. Any anomaly detection system is predicated on the fundamental premise that malicious activity displays traits that are not present in everyday use. 

### Objectives 
* The objective is to detect such malicious network traffic to alleviate their impact on organizations and provide security administrators with automatic alerts 
* This work addresses the issue of malicious network traffic detection using deep convolutional neural network architectures on the modern complex and challenging dataset. 
* The system can detect, classify, and generate alarms for abnormal traffic in the network, with a lower false alarm rate. Based on the dataset, we tested the binary classification of network traffic.

### Outcomes
* As cyberattacks become more advanced and frequent, it’s crucial to incorporate machine learning algorithms and performance metrics to safeguard computer networks. This measure is becoming increasingly 
necessary to ensure the security of networks in the face of threats.
* The data in network traffic can be quite complex and varied, making it difficult to create machine learning algorithms that are accurate. However, with split evaluation, we can evaluate the performance of machine 
learning algorithms on a testing set that is held out. By adopting split evaluation, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of ML algorithms in detecting nefarious attacks in the traffic.
